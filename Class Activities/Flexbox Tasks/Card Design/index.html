        <h1>CINEMA</h1>
        <p>CINEMA is the debut studio album of American indie pop band The Marías, released June 25th, 2021. 
            Its capricious development began even before The Marías had formed. It was their only album to 
            feature bassist Ariel Ferman, as she was fired from the band four months after its release for refusing 
            to get a COVID-19 Vaccine Test due to Abdominal compartment syndrome, and was also their only album as a 
            five-piece.
